# About{.page-title}

Hi there! My name is _Name_, and I'm a graphic designer with a passion for creating beautiful and effective designs. As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, I have spent the past few years honing my skills and developing my expertise in the field. I am excited to use my skills to help businesses and individuals communicate their message through effective visual design.

When I'm not working on design projects, you can find me exploring new hiking trails or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. As an avid outdoor enthusiast, I love spending time in nature and find that it's a great way to recharge my creativity. I also enjoy attending local art exhibitions and music concerts, as I find that these experiences often inspire my design work and keep me up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry. Additionally, I have a passion for photography and love capturing the world around me through my lens. All of these hobbies and interests feed into my design work, and I believe that they help me to approach each project with a unique perspective and creative edge.
