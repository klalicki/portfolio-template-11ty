/* 
If you want to add custom CSS, you should do it in this file.
If you are having a hard time getting your custom CSS to apply, try using more specific section selectors.
For example, if you want to change the color of h2 elements in the main page area,
you may need to use
.text-page h2 instead of just h2.

You can also use !important to override the default CSS, but try to avoid that whenever possible.
