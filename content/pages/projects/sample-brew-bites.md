## Background

As a senior graphic design student interested in branding and visual identity design, I took on the challenging project of redesigning the visual identity for a local café called "Brew and Bites". The café had been in business for three years and had established a loyal customer base. However, the café owner felt that the current visual identity did not accurately reflect the quality of their products and services. Therefore, I was approached by the owner to redesign the visual identity to enhance the café's image and attract new customers.

## Goals

The primary goal of my project was to create a cohesive visual identity for Brew and Bites that accurately reflects the café's unique qualities and differentiates it from competitors in the area. I wanted the design to be modern and memorable while retaining some of the warmth and charm of the current identity. Additionally, I aimed to:

- Develop a comprehensive branding system that includes a logo, typography, color palette, and imagery
- Enhance the overall customer experience by improving the café's signage, menus, packaging, and promotional materials
- Increase brand awareness and attract new customers through a consistent and effective visual identity

## Process

To start, I conducted extensive research on the café's history, values, and customer base. I conducted a series of interviews with the café owner, employees, and regular customers to gain insight into the café's unique qualities and competitive advantages. The research also included a review of competitor brands and an analysis of current design trends in the food and beverage industry.

Based on my research, I developed several design concepts and presented them to the café owner for feedback. The chosen concept was refined through multiple iterations, including feedback from the owner and employees. The final design includes a custom logotype, a warm color palette inspired by the café's cozy interior, and imagery that emphasizes the café's commitment to using fresh, locally-sourced ingredients.

To enhance the customer experience, I also redesigned the café's signage, menus, packaging, and promotional materials. The new design is cohesive and consistent, with a strong emphasis on the café's unique qualities and brand values. For the signage, I wanted to make it easier for people to find the café, so I decided to place a large sign on the building's front. I made it a point to use the same font and color scheme in all the café's signage to maintain brand consistency.

For the menu design, I wanted to create a fresh and modern look, while keeping it easy to read and navigate. I used the same color palette and typography as the rest of the branding, and I incorporated high-quality images of the café's food and drink offerings. The new menu design is more visually appealing and reflects the café's commitment to using locally-sourced, fresh ingredients.

To improve the packaging, I designed a new series of branded coffee cups and to-go boxes, using the same color palette and typography as the rest of the branding. The new packaging is not only more visually appealing, but it also reinforces the café's brand values and commitment to sustainability. I also designed promotional materials, including flyers and posters, to attract new customers.

## Evaluation:

To evaluate the effectiveness of the redesigned visual identity, I conducted a survey among regular customers of Brew and Bites. The survey aimed to measure customer perception of the café's brand image and to identify areas for improvement. The survey consisted of ten questions, including questions on overall satisfaction, brand recognition, and the impact of the new branding on the customer experience.

The survey results were overwhelmingly positive, with 90% of customers indicating that they preferred the new visual identity over the old one. Moreover, 85% of respondents reported that the new branding accurately reflects the café's unique qualities and values. The survey also showed that the new branding has had a positive impact on the customer experience, with 80% of customers indicating that the new branding enhances their overall experience at the café.

Based on the survey results, it is clear that the redesigned visual identity has been successful in enhancing Brew and Bites' brand image and customer experience. The new branding has effectively communicated the café's unique qualities and values, attracting new customers and strengthening relationships with existing ones. The cohesive design has also contributed to a more memorable and recognizable brand image, increasing brand awareness and loyalty.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, my senior thesis project of redesigning the visual identity for Brew and Bites has been a success. The project has allowed me to apply my skills in branding and visual identity design to a real-world problem, providing a valuable solution for a local business. The cohesive visual identity has effectively communicated the café's unique qualities and values, enhancing the overall customer experience and increasing brand awareness. The positive feedback from customers and the café owner has validated the success of the project, demonstrating the importance of effective branding and design in a competitive market. Overall, this project has been a rewarding experience and has allowed me to develop my skills and expertise in branding and visual identity design.
